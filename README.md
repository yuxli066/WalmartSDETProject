# Requirements:

### Unit tests
* Write unit tests to check proper functionality of all business logic. Test for both success and failure.
* Write unit tests to sanity check all view controllers and custom views ([country cell](./CountriesChallenge/Views/CountryCell.swift)).
* Bonus points: Write unit tests for the networking code.

# Solution:
I created 14 Unit Tests to cover 88% of all functions form this project. 

Take a look at the reports below.

Source Code Changes:

* Reworked some functions to modularize guards
* Added getters/setters to some private member variables to allow access from unit tests

NOTE: Some minor code changes are not in the screen shots above. 

### UI tests
* Write UI tests for all the screens (countries list and country detail) to check proper functionality.
* Bonus points: Write UI tests for the search functionality.

# Solution: 

I implemented UI automation tests to: 
  * scroll through every country
  * validate every cell element
  * click every cell and validate details
  * test search functionality

# Acceptance criteria:
* A minimum of 80% test coverage is expected. Bonus points for 90%+ coverage.

# NOTES
* The current implementation may require some refactoring to be properly testable.
* Please zip up your Xcode project and email it â€” do not post on GitHub. Thanks.
